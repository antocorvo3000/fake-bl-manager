# Next milestone

Milestone marker: **companion module/tooling suite + mode taxonomy cleanup**.

## Objectives kept for this milestone

### 1. Recovery graft

Goal: make custom recovery compatible with mode-1 normal Android boot by grafting stock recovery AVB metadata onto the custom recovery image.

Deliverables:

- Host-side script that takes a custom recovery image plus stock recovery metadata/source image and writes a patched image.
- Device-side recovery-graft module that performs the same operation from on-device stock metadata after a custom recovery flash.

Acceptance:

- Patched custom recovery normal-boots Android under mode-1.
- Recovery boot still works.
- Failure modes are loud and reversible; no autonomous non-HLOS flashing is introduced.

### 2. Cache-ABL build path and OTA ZIP flow

Goal: keep gbl-chainload viable across OTAs that change ABL or remove the direct GBL/EFISP loader path, without asking the agent or normal user flow to flash non-HLOS partitions directly.

Deliverables:

- **DONE** — Define how a known-good ABL is cached into gbl-chainload. Implemented as an on-device-generated GBLP1 v1 container appended to the gbl-chainload PE on EFISP. Format and runtime contract specified in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-15-on-device-payload-insertion-design.md`; `GblPayloadLib` is the EFI-side reader.
- **DONE** — Update the dynamic patch engine so it deliberately skips the cached ABL payload. `DynamicPatchLib`'s post-patch efisp byte-scan gate (T2.3) rejects any patched PE that still contains UTF-16 LE `efisp` bytes. The Tier 1 short-circuit in `BootFlow.c` (T2.7) means Tier 2 dynamic patching is never attempted when the cached overlay loads successfully.
- **SUPERSEDED** — Add `scripts/build.sh --cache-abl <path>`. This flag is removed. The EFI no longer accepts a build-time payload; on-device generation via `tools/gbl-pack` at install time replaces this build path entirely.
- **DONE** — Cross-compile the recovery tools (`fv-unwrap`, `abl-patcher`, `gbl-pack`, `gbl-commit`) as aarch64-Android static binaries (NDK r27 in `docker/Dockerfile`; orchestrated by `scripts/build-recovery-tools.sh`).
- **FOLLOW-UP** — Assemble the post-OTA custom-recovery installer ZIP that orchestrates the tools. Descoped from the on-device-payload-insertion PR to its own line of work (the ZIP-methodology effort); see `docs/project/zip-methodology.md`.
- **FOLLOW-UP** — Document the user-owned fallback file `/sdcard/backup_abl.img`; it belongs with the installer ZIP and lands with it.

Acceptance:

- The installed gbl-chainload artifact (base EFI + appended GBLP1 overlay) uses the cached ABL via Tier 1 without running dynamic patches against the cached payload. Tier 2 dynamic patching remains available as fallback for the no-overlay case.
- Builds without an appended overlay keep current behavior (Tier 2 dynamic patch path).
- The ZIP instructions use custom recovery: flash OTA, flash gbl-chainload installer ZIP, then flash recovery-graft ZIP.
- User fallback naming is stable and documented as `/sdcard/backup_abl.img`.
- EFISP/artifact capacity assumptions are checked before publishing the flow (no proactive gate; `dd` errors on overrun; `gbl-commit --verify` + `/sdcard/efisp.bak` backup are the recovery medium).
- No direct flash of non-HLOS partitions is required from the agent workflow.

### 3. Mode-2 profiles

Goal: turn mode-2 from mechanism into a maintainable profile-driven flow.

Deliverables:

- Decide and document the parked profile format and naming convention; current placeholder: `/sdcard/gbl-chainload_profile.xml`.
- Build/populate the profile from `/sdcard/stock_vbmeta.img` when the profile does not already exist.
- Produce a separate mode-2 ZIP that layers on top of the cache-ABL work rather than replacing it.
- Keep cache-ABL support in mode-2 builds.
- Provide profile validation and clear stale/missing-profile errors.

Acceptance:

- Profile lifecycle is documented around stock vbmeta, vendor blobs, and security patch level.
- Missing profile behavior either populates from `/sdcard/stock_vbmeta.img` or fails closed with exact user instructions.
- Stale profile behavior fails closed and explains what the user must update.
- Mode-2 ZIP output is separate from the mode-1 gbl-chainload/recovery-graft ZIP flow.

### 4. Drop mode-3

Goal: remove never-implemented mode-3 from roadmap, docs, build expectations, and any user-facing mode taxonomy.

Acceptance:

- README and build help do not advertise mode-3.
- Remaining edk2 user-facing mode-3 strings are removed from `FastbootCmds.c` and `FastbootMenu.c` in the edk2 submodule flow.
- Any code comments or tests that imply mode-3 support are removed or rewritten.
- Modes 0, 1, and 2 remain clearly defined.

## Explicitly de-scoped / dropped

- AVB input façade / userspace partition-read façade.
- Synth/graft fastboot command surface (`synthesize-and-flash`, `graft-from-staged`, `fix-vbmeta-footer`).
- Mode-3 as a future feature.
- Old Phase-1 implementation plans/specs.
- RE session transcripts as durable project documentation.

## Suggested implementation order

1. Documentation/code cleanup for mode-3 removal.
2. Cache-ABL static payload design and `--cache-abl` build flag.
3. gbl-chainload ZIP flow that uses `/sdcard/backup_abl.img` as the stable fallback convention.
4. Recovery graft ZIP, because the preferred OTA path is custom recovery OTA flash followed by gbl-chainload ZIP and recovery-graft ZIP.
5. Mode-2 ZIP/profile flow layered on top of cache-ABL, using `/sdcard/gbl-chainload_profile.xml` and `/sdcard/stock_vbmeta.img` conventions unless superseded by implementation evidence.

Each item should land as one or more feature branches with PRs against `main`.
