/* tests/host/helpers/test_sha256.c
   FIPS 180-4 known-answer test for the vendored gbl_sha256.

   These vectors pin the vendored implementation to the SHA-256 standard,
   which is what makes it interchangeable with any other conforming
   SHA-256 (EDK2 BaseCryptLib, host libcrypto, ...). The same source file
   is compiled into the EFI shim and the host/Android gbl-pack, so a pass
   here means producer and consumer hash identically. */
